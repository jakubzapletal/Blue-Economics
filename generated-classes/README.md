To regenerate classes in this folder run `/vendor/bin/propel model:build` The generated code is dependent on `/schema
.xml` in the root of the project. `schema.xml` was initially generated via `/vendor/bin/propel database:reverse`
after executing `/faq-app/DatabaseModel/blueecon-faq-ddl.sql` which in turn can be generated from [MySQLWorkbench]
(http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) by loading `blueecon-faq.mwb` and saving the sql generated by
`Database > Forward Engineer`

Add custom code to classes in this folder. Classes in `Base` and `Map` shouldn't be touched.
