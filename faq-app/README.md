FAQ Application Notes
=====================

####Building FAQ database tables
- Run `DatabaseModel/blueecon-faq-ddl.sql` against your mysql instance to generate the faq tables
- blueecon-faq.mwb is an entity relationship diagram for the FAQ application. It can be opened in [MySQLWorkbench]()

####Propel Setup
- `/schema.xml` is a description of the database schema generated by running `/vendor/bin/propel reverse:database`
- `/runtime-conf.xml` is used by [Propel](http://propelorm.org/) to produce `/generated-conf/config.php` which links
the generated classes to the correct database at runtime. The conversion of `runtime-conf.xml` to `config.php` is
achieved via `/vendor/bin/propel config:convert-xml`
- `/vendor/bin/propel model:build` generates the php classes in `generated-classes` from `/schema.xml`. When
extending Propel generated classes, add code to classes in `generated-classes`. Do not touch the classes in
`generated-classes/Base` or `generated-classes/Map`


####FAQApi
- API for FAQ application interactions. Provides methods to create Questions, Experts, ExpertGroups,
ExpertGroup membership. As well as track expert Responses to Questions.
